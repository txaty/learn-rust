Returning `Result` is a good default choice when you're defining a function that might fail.
In situations such as examples, prototype code, and tests, it’s more appropriate to write code that panics instead of returning a `Result`.

When you’re writing an example to illustrate some concept, also including robust error-handling code can make the example less clear.
The `unwrap` and `expect` methods are very handy when prototyping, before you’re ready to decide how to handle errors. They leave clear markers in your code for when you’re ready to make your program more robust.
If a method call fails in a test, you’d want the whole test to fail, even if that method isn’t the functionality under test. Because `panic!` is how a test is marked as a failure, calling `unwrap` or `expect` is exactly what should happen.

It would also be appropriate to call `unwrap` or `expect` when you have some other logic that ensures the `Result` will have an `Ok` value, but the logic isn’t something the compiler understands.

It’s advisable to have your code panic when it’s possible that your code could end up in a bad state. In this context, a _bad state_ is when some assumption, guarantee, contract, or invariant has been broken, such as when invalid values, contradictory values, or missing values are passed to your code—plus one or more of the following:

- The bad state is something that is unexpected, as opposed to something that will likely happen occasionally, like a user entering data in the wrong format.
- Your code after this point needs to rely on not being in this bad state, rather than checking for the problem at every step.
- There’s not a good way to encode this information in the types you use. We’ll work through an example of what we mean in the [“Encoding States and Behavior as Types”](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch17-03-oo-design-patterns.html#encoding-states-and-behavior-as-types) section of Chapter 17.
