A trait defines functionality a particular type has and can share with other types. We can use traits to define shared behavior in an abstract way. We can use trait bounds to specify that a generic type can be any type that has certain behavior.
```rust
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String;
}

pub struct NewsArticle {
    pub headline: String,
    pub location: String,
    pub author: String,
    pub content: String,
}

impl Summary for NewsArticle {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}, by {} ({})", self.headline, self.author, self.location)
    }
}

pub struct Tweet {
    pub username: String,
    pub content: String,
    pub reply: bool,
    pub retweet: bool,
}

impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
    }
}
```

One restriction is that we can implement a trait on a type only if at least one of the trait or the type is local to our crate.
This restriction is part of a property called _coherence_, and more specifically the _orphan rule_, so named because the parent type is not present. This rule ensures that other people’s code can’t break your code and vice versa. Without the rule, two crates could implement the same trait for the same type, and Rust wouldn’t know which implementation to use.

## Traits as Parameters
```rust
pub fn notify(item: &impl Summary) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}
```

### Trait Bound Syntax
```rust
pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item: &T) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}
```

```rust
pub fn notify(item1: &impl Summary, item2: &impl Summary) {
```

```rust
pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item1: &T, item2: &T) {
```

### Specifying Multiple Trait Bounds with the `+` Syntax
```rust
pub fn notify(item: &(impl Summary + Display)) {
```

```rust
pub fn notify<T: Summary + Display>(item: &T) {
```

### Clearer Trait Bounds with `where` Clauses
```rust
pub fn notify<T: Summary + Display>(item: &T) {
```

```rust
fn some_function<T, U>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32
where
    T: Display + Clone,
    U: Clone + Debug,
{
```

## Returning Types that Implement Traits

```rust
fn returns_summarizable() -> impl Summary {
    Tweet {
        username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
        content: String::from(
            "of course, as you probably already know, people",
        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    }
}
```
However, you can only use `impl Trait` if you’re returning a single type. For example, this code that returns either a `NewsArticle` or a `Tweet` with the return type specified as `impl Summary` wouldn’t work.

## Using Trait Bounds to Conditionally Implement Methods
By using a trait bound with an `impl` block that uses generic type parameters, we can implement methods conditionally for types that implement the specified traits.
```rust
use std::fmt::Display;

struct Pair<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl<T> Pair<T> {
    fn new(x: T, y: T) -> Self {
        Self { x, y }
    }
}

impl<T: Display + PartialOrd> Pair<T> {
    fn cmp_display(&self) {
        if self.x >= self.y {
            println!("The largest member is x = {}", self.x);
        } else {
            println!("The largest member is y = {}", self.y);
        }
    }
}
```

We can also conditionally implement a trait for any type that implements another trait. Implementations of a trait on any type that satisfies the trait bounds are called _blanket implementations_ and are extensively used in the Rust standard library.
```rust
impl<T: Display> ToString for T {
    // --snip--
}
```
Blanket implementations appear in the documentation for the trait in the “Implementors” section.
