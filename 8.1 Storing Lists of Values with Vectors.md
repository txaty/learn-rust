## Creating a New Vector
```rust
let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
```

Create with initial values and `vec!` macro:
```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
```

## Updating a Vector
```rust
let mut v = Vec::new();

v.push(1);
v.push(2);
v.push(3);
```
The numbers we place inside are all of type `i32`, and Rust infers this from the data, so we don't need the `Vec<i32>` annotation.

## Reading Elements of Vectors
Via indexing or using the `get` method.
```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let third: &i32 = &v[2];
println!("The third element is {third}");

let third: Option<&i32> = v.get(2);
match third {
	Some(third) => println!("The third element is {third}"),
	None => println!("There is no third element."),
}
```

## Iterating over the Values in a Vector
Immutable:
```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

for n_ref in &v {
	let n_plus_one: i32 = *n_ref + 1;
	println!("{n_plus_one}");
}
```

Mutable:
```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];

for n_ref in &mut v {
	*n_ref += 50;
}
```

Non-copyable types cannot be moved out of a vector by indexing. Only methods such as `Vec::remove` permit moving out of a vector.

## Safely Using Iterators
One important detail is that iterators contain a pointer to data within a vector.
```rust
let mut v: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2];
let mut iter: Iter<'_, i32> = v.iter();
let n1: &i32 = iter.next.unwrap();
let n2: &i32 = iter.next.unwrap();
let end: Option<&i32> = iter.next();
```

One way to iterate over a vector without using a pointer is with a range:
```rust
let mut v: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2];
let mut iter: Range<usize> = 0 .. v.len();
let i1: usize = iter.next().unwrap();
let n1: &i32 = &v[i1];
```

## Using an Enum to Store Multiple Types
Rust needs to know what types will be in the vector at compile time so it knows exactly how much memory on the heap will be needed to store each element.
We must also be explicit about what types are allowed in this vector.
If Rust allowed a vector to hold any type, there would be a chance that one or more of the types would cause errors with the operations performed on the elements of the vector.

## Dropping a Vector Drops Its Elements
A vector freed when it goes out of scope.
When the vector gets dropped, all of its contents are also dropped, meaning the integers it holds will be cleaned up. The borrow checker ensures that any references to contents to contents of a vector are only used while the vector itself is valid.
