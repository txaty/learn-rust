# Functions

Rust code uses snake case as the conventional style for function and variable names.

Rust doesn't care where you define your functions, only that they're defined somewhere in a scope that can be seen by the caller.

## Parameters

Technically, the concrete values are called arguments, but in casual conversation, people tend to use the words parameter and argument interchangeably for either the variables in a function's definition or the concrete values passed in when you call a function.

## Statements and Expressions

Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
Expressions evaluate to a resulting value.

## Functions with Return Values

We don't name return values, but we must declare their type after an arrow(```->```).
