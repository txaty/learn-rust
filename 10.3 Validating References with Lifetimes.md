Rather than ensuring that a type has the behavior we want, lifetimes ensure that references are valid as long as we need them to be.
Every reference in Rust has a lifetime, which is the scope for which that reference is valid.
Most of the time, lifetimes are implicit and inferred, just like most of the time, types are inferred. We only must annotate types when multiple types are possible.

## Preventing Dangling References with Lifetimes
The main aim of lifetimes is to prevent dangling references, which cause a program to reference data other than the data it's intended to reference.

## The Borrow Checker Ensures Data Outlives Its References
The Rust compiler's borrow checker will compare scopes to determine whether all borrows are valid.

## Lifetime Annotation Syntax
Lifetime annotations don't change how long any of the references live. Rather, they describe the relationships of the lifetimes of multiple references to each other without affecting the lifetimes.
Just as functions can accept any type when the signature specifies a generic type parameter, functions can accept references with any lifetime by specifying a generic lifetime parameter.
The names of lifetime parameters must start with an apostrophe (`'`) and are usually all lowercase and very short, like generic types.
```rust
&i32         // a reference
&'a i32      // a reference with an explicit lifetime
&'a mut i32  // a mutable reference with an explicit lifetime
```

## Lifetime Annotations in Function Signatures
To use lifetime annotations in function signatures, we need to declare the generic lifetime parameters inside angle brackets between the function name and the parameter list, just as we did with generic type parameters.
We want the signature to express the following constraint: the returned reference will be valid as long as both the parameters are valid. This is the relationship between lifetimes of the parameters and the return value.
```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
```
The function signature now tells Rust that for some lifetime `'a`, the function takes two parameters, both of which are string slices that live at least as long as lifetime `'a`. The function signature also tells Rust that the string slice returned from the function will live at least as long as lifetime `'a`. In practice, it means that the lifetime of the reference returned by the `longest` function is the same as the smaller of the lifetimes of the values referred to by the function arguments. These relationships are what we want Rust to use when analyzing this code.
When we specify the lifetime parameters in this function signature, we're not changing the lifetimes of any values passed in or returned.
Rather, we are specifying that the borrow checker should reject any values that don’t adhere to these constraints.
When annotating lifetimes in functions, the annotations go in the function signature, not in the function body. The lifetime annotations become part of the contract of the function, much like the types in the signature.
Having function signatures contain the lifetime contract means the analysis the Rust compiler does can be simpler. If there’s a problem with the way a function is annotated or the way it is called, the compiler errors can point to the part of our code and the constraints more precisely.
If, instead, the Rust compiler made more inferences about what we intended the relationships of the lifetimes to be, the compiler might only be able to point to a use of our code many steps away from the cause of the problem.

Example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("long string is long");

    {
        let string2 = String::from("xyz");
        let result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());
        println!("The longest string is {}", result);
    }
}
```
In this example, `string1` is valid until the end of the outer scope, `string2` is valid until the end of the inner scope, and `result` references something that is valid until the end of the inner scope.

Another example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("long string is long");
    let result;
    {
        let string2 = String::from("xyz");
        result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());
    }
    println!("The longest string is {}", result);
}
```
This won't compile, as borrowed value, `string2.as_str()` , does not live long enough.

## Thinking in Terms of Lifetimes
When returning a reference from a function, the lifetime parameter for the return type needs to match the lifetime parameter for one of the parameters.
When returning a reference from a function, the lifetime parameter for the return type needs to match the lifetime parameter for one of the parameters. If the reference returned does not refer to one of the parameters, it must refer to a value created within this function.
However, this would be a dangling reference because the value will go out of scope at the end of the function.

## Lifetime Annotations in Struct Definitions
As with generic data types, we declare the name of the generic lifetime parameter inside angle brackets after the name of the struct so we can use the lifetime parameter in the body of the struct definition.
```rust
struct ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
    part: &'a str,
}

fn main() {
    let novel = String::from("Call me Ishmael. Some years ago...");
    let first_sentence = novel.split('.').next().expect("Could not find a '.'");
    let i = ImportantExcerpt {
        part: first_sentence,
    };
}
```
This means that an instance of `ImportantExcerpt` can't outlive the reference it holds in its `part` field.
The `main` function here creates an instance of the `ImportantExcerpt` struct that holds a reference to the first sentence of the `String` owned by the variable `novel`. The data in `novel` exists before the `ImportantExcerpt` instance is created. In addition, `novel` doesn’t go out of scope until after the `ImportantExcerpt` goes out of scope, so the reference in the `ImportantExcerpt` instance is valid.

## Lifetime Elision
The patterns programmed into Rust's analysis of references are called the lifetime elision rules.If your code fits these cases, you don't need to write the lifetimes explicitly.
The elision rules don’t provide full inference. If Rust deterministically applies the rules but there is still ambiguity as to what lifetimes the references have, the compiler won’t guess what the lifetime of the remaining references should be. Instead of guessing, the compiler will give you an error that you can resolve by adding the lifetime annotations.
Lifetimes on function or method parameters are called _input lifetimes_, and lifetimes on return values are called _output lifetimes_.
The compiler uses three rules to figure out the lifetimes of the references when there aren’t explicit annotations. The first rule applies to input lifetimes, and the second and third rules apply to output lifetimes. If the compiler gets to the end of the three rules and there are still references for which it can’t figure out lifetimes, the compiler will stop with an error. These rules apply to `fn` definitions as well as `impl` blocks.
The first rule is that the compiler assigns a different lifetime parameter to each lifetime in each input type. References like `&'_ i32` needs a lifetime parameter, and structures like `ImportantExcerpt<'_>` need a lifetime parameter. For example:

- The function `fn foo(x: &i32)` would get one lifetime parameter and become `fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32)`.
- The function `fn foo(x: &i32, y: &i32)` would get two lifetime parameters and become `fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32)`.
- The function `fn foo(x: &ImportantExcerpt)` would get two lifetime parameters and become `fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a ImportantExcerpt<'b>)`.

The second rule is that, if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters: `fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32`.

The third rule is that, if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is `&self` or `&mut self` because this is a method, the lifetime of `self` is assigned to all output lifetime parameters. This third rule makes methods much nicer to read and write because fewer symbols are necessary.

## Lifetime Annotations in Method Definitions
Lifetime names for struct fields always need to be declared after the `impl` keyword and then used after the struct’s name, because those lifetimes are part of the struct’s type.
In method signatures inside the `impl` block, references might be tied to the lifetime of references in the struct’s fields, or they might be independent. In addition, the lifetime elision rules often make it so that lifetime annotations aren’t necessary in method signatures.

## The Static Lifetime
One special lifetime we need to discuss is `'static`, which denotes that the affected reference _can_ live for the entire duration of the program. All string literals have the `'static` lifetime, which we can annotate as follows:

```rust
let s: &'static str = "I have a static lifetime.";
```

The text of this string is stored directly in the program’s binary, which is always available. Therefore, the lifetime of all string literals is `'static`.
