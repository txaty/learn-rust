The `println!` macro can do many kinds of formatting, and by default, the curly brackets tell `println!` to use formatting know as `Display`: output intended for direct end user consumption. The primitive types we've seen so far implement `Display` by default because there's only one way you'd want to show a `1` or any other primitive type to a user. But with structs, the way `println!` should format the output is less clear because there are more display possibilities.
Putting a specifier `:?` inside the curly brackets tells `println!` we want to use an output format called `Debug`.
To make the output more readable especially when the struct is large, we can use specifier `:#?`.

Another way to print out a value using the `Debug` format is to use the `dbg!` macro, which takes ownership of an expression (as opposed to `println!`, which takes a reference)
