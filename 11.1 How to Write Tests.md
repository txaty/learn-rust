The bodies of test functions typically perform these three actions:
1. Set up any needed data or state
2. Run the code you want to test
3. Assert the results are what you expect.  

## The Anatomy of a Test Function
`#[test]` attribute indicates this is a test function, so the test runner knows to treat this function as a test.
We might also have non-test functions in the `tests` module to help set up common scenarios or perform common operations, so we always need to indicate which functions are tests.
