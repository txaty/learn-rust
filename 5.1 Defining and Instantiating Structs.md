# Defining and Instantiating Structs

Structs are just like tuples.
Unlike with tuples, in a struct you will name each piece of data so it's clear what the values mean.

## Field Init Shorthand

```rust
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email,
        username,
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}
```

## Creating Instance From Other Instances With Struct Update syntax

```rust
fn main() {
    // --snip--
    let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("someone.else@example.com"),
        ..user1
    };
}
```

We can no longer use ```user1``` after creating ```user2``` because the ```String``` in the ```username``` field of ```user1``` has been moved to ```user2```.

## Using Tuple Structs without named Fields to Create Different Types

Tuple structs have the added meaning the struct name provides but don't have names associated with their fields;
rather, they just have the types of the fields. You can use a ```.``` followed by the index to access a individual value.

## Unit-Like Structs Without Any Fields

Structs that don't have any fields are called unit-like structs because they behave similarly to (), the unit type.

## Ownership of Struct Data
It's possible for structs to store references to data owned by something else, but to do so requires the use of lifetimes.
Lifetimes ensure that the data referenced by a struct is valid for as long as the struct is.

## Borrowing Fields o a Struct
Rust's borrow checker will track ownership permissions at both the struct-level and field-level.
For example, if we borrow a field `x` of a `Point` structure, then both `p` and `p.x` temporarily lose their permissions (but not `p.y`).
