By default, these panics will print a failure message, unwind, clean up the stack, and quit.
By default, when a panic occurs, the program starts _unwinding_, which means Rust walks back up the stack and cleans up the data from each function it encounters. However, this walking back and cleanup is a lot of work. Rust, therefore, allows you to choose the alternative of immediately _aborting_, which ends the program without cleaning up.
Memory that the program was using will then need to be cleaned up by the operating system. If in your project you need to make the resulting binary as small as possible, you can switch from unwinding to aborting upon a panic by adding `panic = 'abort'` to the appropriate `[profile]` sections in your _Cargo.toml_ file.

```toml
[profile.release]
panic = 'abort'
```

A panic should not be used to communicate failure within the program. The default assumption is that caller functions will not try to catch panics.
