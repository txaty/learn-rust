## Ownership vs. GC
Most programming languages use a GC to manage memory, such as Python, Js, Java, and Go.
A GC works at runtime adjacent to a running program (a tracing collector, at least). The collector scans through memory to find data that's no longer used - that is, the running program can no longer reach that data from a function-local variable. Then the collector deallocates unused memory for later use.
Drawbacks: 
- Performance. Either frequent small overheads (for reference-counting, like in Python and Swift) or infrequent large overheads (for tracing, like in all other GC'd languages).
- Unpredictable. It's often difficult to predict where data will be GC-ed just by reading the source code.

## The Concept of Ownership
### Ownership at Runtime
How Rust uses memory at runtime:
- Rust allocates local variables in stack frames, which are allocated when a function is called and deallocated when the call ends.
- Local variables can hold either data (like numbers, booleans, tuples, etc.) or pointers.
- Pointers can be created either through boxes (pointers owning data on the heap) or references (non-owning pointers).

### Ownership at Compile Time
A variable's permissions can be changed if it is moved or borrowed. A move of a variable with a non-copyable type requires RO permissions, and the move eliminates all permissions on the variable.
Borrowing a variable (creating a reference to it) temporarily removes some of the variable's permissions. An immutable borrow creates an immutable reference, and also disables the borrowed data from being mutated or moved.
- Printing an immutable reference is ok
- Mutating an immutable reference is not ok
- Mutating the immutably borrowed data is not ok
- Moving data out of the reference is not ok
A mutable borrow creates a mutable reference, which disables the borrowed data from being read, written, or moved.
- Mutating a mutable reference is ok
- Accessing the mutably borrowed data is not ok
