Slice let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection.
A slice is a kind of reference, so it does not have ownership. It's a non-owning pointer.

Slices are special kinds of references because they are "fat" pointers, or pointers with metadata.
## String Slices

A string slice is a reference to part of a string.

String slice range indices must occur at valid UTF-8 character boundaries.

One advantage of slices over index-based ranges is that the slice cannot be invalidated while it's being used.
