Unlike languages like Java where all objects have a set of core methods like `Object.toString()`, there are no core methods in Rust. Without restrictions, a generic type `T` has no capabilities: it cannot be printed, cloned, or mutated (although it can be dropped).

## In Method Definitions
```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl<T> Point<T> {
    fn x(&self) -> &T {
        &self.x
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };

    println!("p.x = {}", p.x());
}
```

We have to declare `T` just after `impl` so we can use `T` to specify that we're implementing methods on the type `Point<T>`.
By declaring `T` as generic type after `impl`, Rust can identify that the type in the angle brackets in `Point` is a generic type rather than a concrete type.
We can also specify constraints on generic types when defining methods on the type. We could, for example, implement methods only on `Point<f32>` instances rather than on `Point<T>` instances with any generic type.
```rust
impl Point<f32> {
    fn distance_from_origin(&self) -> f32 {
        (self.x.powi(2) + self.y.powi(2)).sqrt()
    }
}
```

## Performance of Code Using Generics
Using generic types won't make your program run any slower than it would with concrete types.
Rust accomplishes this by performing monomorphization of the code using generics at compile time. Monomorphization is the process of turning generic code into specific code by filling in the concrete types that are used when compiled.
