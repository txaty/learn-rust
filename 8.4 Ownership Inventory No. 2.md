In a situation where the borrow checker rejects an operation that is actually safe and has no workaround, then unsafe code is sometimes acceptable if it's critical to avoid allocations.
```rust
fn reverse(v: &mut Vec<String>) {
	let n = v.len();
	for i in 0 .. n / 2 {
		let p1 = &mut v[i] as *mut String;
		let p2 = &mut v[n - i - 1] as *mut String;
		unsafe { std::ptr::swap_nonoverlapping(p1, p2, 1); }
	}
}
```
