Unlike the built-in array and tuple types, the data these collections point to is stored on the heap, which means the amount of data does not need to be known at compile time and can grow or shrink as the program runs.
- Vector allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other.
- String is a collection of characters.
- Hash Map allows you to associate a value with a particular key.
