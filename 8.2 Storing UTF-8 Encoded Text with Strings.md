Rust has only one string type, `str`, the string slice.
The `String` type, which is provided by Rust's standard library rather than coded into the core language, is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded string type.

## Creating a New String
`String` is actually implemented as a wrapper around a vector of bytes with some extra guarantees, restrictions, and capabilities.
```rust
let mut s = String::new();
```

```rust
let data = "initial contents";

let s = data.to_string();

// the method also works on a literal directly;
let s = "initial contents".to_string();
```

```rust
let s = String::from("initial contents");
```

Strings are UTF-8 encoded.

## Updating a String
### Appending to a String with `push_str` and `push`
```rust
let mut s = String::from("foo");
s.push_str("bar");
```

## Concatenation with the `+` Operator or the `format!` Macro
```rust
let s1 = String::from(Hello, );
let s2 = String::from("world!");
let s3 = s1 + &s2; // note s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used
```
1. `add` takes ownership of `s1`.
2. It appends a copy of the contents of `s2` and `s1`.
3. And then it returns back ownership of `s1`.

# Indexing into Strings
Rust strings don't support indexing.
## Internal Representation
A `String` is wrapper over a `Vec<u8>`.

## Byte and Scalar Values and Grapheme Clusters
A final reason Rust doesn't allow us to index into a `String` to get a character is that indexing operation are expected to always take constant time O(1). But it's not possible to guarantee that performance with a `String`, because Rust would have to walk through the contents from the beginning to the index to determine how many valid characters there were.

## Slicing Strings
Rather than indexing using `[]` with a single number, you can use `[]` with a range to create a string slice containing particular bytes.
Use ranges to create string slices with caution because doing so can crash the program.

## Methods for Iterating Over Strings
For individual Unicode scalar values, use the `chars` method.
```rust
for c in "Зд".chars() 
{ 
	println!("{c}"); 
}
```

The `bytes` method returns each raw byte, which might be appropriate for your domain:
```rust
for b in "Зд".bytes() 
{ 
	println!("{b}"); 
}
```

`&str` is a promise that the byte sequence it points to will always be valid UTF-8.
