`cargo test` compiles your code in test mode and runs the resulting test binary.
The default behavior of the binary produced by `cargo test` is to run all the tests in parallel and capture output generated during test runs, preventing the output from being displayed and making it easier to read the output related to the test results.

## Running Tests in Parallel or Consecutively
When you run multiple tests, by default they run in parallel using threads, meaning they finish running faster and you get feedback quicker.
Because the tests are running at the same time, you must make sure your tests don’t depend on each other or on any shared state, including a shared environment, such as the current working directory or environment variables.
Send the `--test-threads` flag and the number of threads you want to use to the test binary:
```bash
cargo test -- --test-theads=1
```

## Showing Function Output
By default, if a test passes, Rust's test library captures anything printed to standard output.
if we want to see printed values for passing tests as well, we can:
```rust
cargo test -- --show-output
```

## Running a Subset of Tests by Names
You can choose which tests to run by passing `cargo test` the name or names of the test(s) you want to run as an argument.
### Running Single Tests
We can pass the name of any test function to `cargo test` to run only that test.
### Filtering to Run Multiple Tests
We can specify part of a test name, and any test whose name matches that value will be run.
## Ignoring Some Tests Unless Specifically Requested
After `#[test]` we add the `#[ignore]` line to the test we want to exclude.
f we want to run only the ignored tests, we can use `cargo test -- --ignored`.
If you want to run all tests whether they’re ignored or not, you can run `cargo test -- --include-ignored`.
